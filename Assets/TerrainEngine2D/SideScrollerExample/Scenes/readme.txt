The MenuExample requires additional setup before you can use it. See below:

  1.  Load the Menu Example scene
  2.  Open up the Build Settings (File -> Build Settings or Ctrl + Shift + B)
  3.  Press the Add Open Scenes button
  4.  Repeat steps 1-3 for the SideScrollerExample scene
  5.  With the Build Settings still open ensure that the MenuExample scene is in the 
      top position (index 0) and the SideScrollerExample is just below it (index 1). 
      You can reposition them by clicking and dragging.
  6.  Then you can close out of the Build Settings and reload the Menu Example scene.
  7.  Now you're all set, the Menu Example is ready to go! Hit play and test it out.
