Lite Frustrum Culling

Just add LFC.cs script to your camera object (or a empty one) in your scene
This is very useful to cull selected objects with appropriate tag, in this case 'Respawn' tag, assign it to a every gameObject you want to control using the script
Take a look at the gameobject in the demo under [City] in the Hierarchy. It's all you need to activate the Frustrum Culling

Cheers!
